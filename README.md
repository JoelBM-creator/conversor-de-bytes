## Summary
This is a project of one of the activities that I do in my training.
<br />
It is a Bytes conversion application written in Java, the code itself can be improved. 
<br />
But for a first contact with Android Studio it is not bad.
<br /> <br />
You can modify and use this repository however you want <br /> but please refer the creator, thanks â™¥ .
